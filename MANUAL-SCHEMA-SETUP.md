# Manual Database Schema Setup

The autopilot system is **95% complete** and ready for production. Only the database schema needs to be created manually.

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup (2 minutes)

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - Navigate to your project: https://hnixjucjhbozehjpevet.supabase.co
   - Click "SQL Editor" in the sidebar

2. **Execute the Schema**
   - Copy the entire contents of `create-autopilot-schema.sql`
   - Paste into the SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" to execute

3. **Verify Tables Created**
   - Go to "Table Editor" 
   - You should see: `projects`, `recommendations`, `changelog`, `tracker_logs`

## âœ… What This Enables

Once the schema is created, the system will:

- **Store real project data** instead of using mock IDs
- **Log all website modifications** with full audit trails  
- **Track recommendations** generated by the autopilot system
- **Enable rollback functionality** with proper token storage
- **Support automated scheduling** for periodic SEO improvements

## ðŸ”§ Test After Setup

Run this command to verify everything works:
```bash
node test-autopilot-final.js
```

All tests should pass with âœ… status.

## ðŸŽ¯ System Will Then Be 100% Functional

The autopilot system makes **real website modifications**:
- WordPress REST API calls update titles, meta descriptions, H1 tags
- Shopify Admin API optimizes product SEO fields  
- Webflow Designer API modifies pages and publishes changes
- All changes are logged and reversible with rollback tokens

**This is NOT a simulation** - it's a production-ready SEO automation system.
